## Jimin's Portfolio

With the intention of developing this site as a personal portfolio, it has become a constant drain of my time to create it without using any libraries. Nevertheless, I will update this site whenever I find the time and when I have new projects to put up. Because it is always in a state of development, there may be features or parts of the page that are not fully functional or buggy. Do not hesitate to let me know if you find anything that isn't intentional.
